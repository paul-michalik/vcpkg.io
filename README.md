# vcpkg.io

Manage bundles created by https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg 

The [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) community is doing a great job to provide a brewing package manager for the Windows platform. However, vcpkg does not directly cover the distribution of compatible bundles of binaries and other artifacts. This is where `vcpkg.io` jumps in. It helps to maintain, deploy and consume pre-built vcpkg artifacts. vcpkg.io consists of one front-end script `vcpkgi.io` which supports few commands to accomplish this task. 

`vcpkg.io clone [[options] <repository> <directory>]`

Clones the master from `[url]` into a folder `vcpkg.io/<name>`. Default is to clone from https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git into `vcpkg.io/vcpkg`. 

Examples:
* `vcpkg.io clone`
* `vcpkg.io clone https://github.com/paul-michalik/vcpkg.git vcpkg-paul-michalik`

Synopsis:
* `git clone [options] <repository> <directory>`

`vcpkg.io pull <folder>`

Pulls the master from `[url]` into a folder `vcpkg.io/<name>`. Default is to pull the latest master from https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git into `vcpkg.io/vcpkg`. 

Examples:
* `vcpkg.io pull`
* `vcpkg.io pull -url https://github.com/paul-michalik/vcpkg.git -into vcpkg-paul-michalik`

Synopsis:
* `git clone "%Url%" "%Into%" & cd "%Into%" & git checkout -b master`
* `cd "%Into%" & git checkout -b master & git pull`

`vcpkg.io download <revision> [url]` 

Downloads the `[revision]` given by Git commit hash from `[url]` into a folder `vcpkg.io/[revision]`. Default `[url]` is `https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg`. Examples:
* `vcpkg.io download f279e9f5e3a569b237dbaca44bbc7225f1d7e27d`
* `vcpkg.io download 240d1d2facc5407fbd002b678f561bfacaccdee7 https://github.com/paul-michalik/vcpkg` Â
