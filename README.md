# vcpkg.io

Manage bundles created by https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg 

The [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) community is doing a great job to provide a brewing package manager for the Windows platform. However, vcpkg does not directly cover the distribution of compatible bundles of binaries and other artifacts. This is where `vcpkg.io` jumps in. It helps to maintain, deploy and consume pre-built vcpkg artifacts. vcpkg.io consists of one front-end script `vcpkgi.io` which supports few commands to accomplish this task. 

## clone

`vcpkg.io clone [[options] <repository> <directory>]`

Clones from `<repository>` into a folder `<directory>`. Default is to clone from https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git into `vcpkg.io/vcpkg`.
